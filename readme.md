Initial Data:

ProductsData is an array of objects with a name property.
searchProduct is the string 'apple'.
Filter Method:

.filter(e => ...) iterates over each element e in the ProductsData array and applies the provided function to test whether the element should be included in the new array.
Iteration and Conditions:

For each product e in ProductsData, the function e => ... is executed.
Iteration Details:
First Iteration (e is { name: 'Apple' }):

e.name.toLowerCase(): 'Apple'.toLowerCase() results in 'apple'.
searchProduct.toLowerCase(): 'apple'.toLowerCase() results in 'apple'.
Condition Check:
'apple'.startsWith('apple') is true.
'apple' !== 'apple' is false.
Result: This product is excluded because the second condition is false.
Second Iteration (e is { name: 'Applesauce' }):

e.name.toLowerCase(): 'Applesauce'.toLowerCase() results in 'applesauce'.
Condition Check:
'applesauce'.startsWith('apple') is true.
'applesauce' !== 'apple' is true.
Result: This product is included because both conditions are true.
Third Iteration (e is { name: 'Banana' }):

e.name.toLowerCase(): 'Banana'.toLowerCase() results in 'banana'.
Condition Check:
'banana'.startsWith('apple') is false.
Result: This product is excluded because the first condition is false.
Fourth Iteration (e is { name: 'Apricot' }):

e.name.toLowerCase(): 'Apricot'.toLowerCase() results in 'apricot'.
Condition Check:
'apricot'.startsWith('apple') is false.
Result: This product is excluded because the first condition is false.
Fifth Iteration (e is { name: 'apple' }):

e.name.toLowerCase(): 'apple'.toLowerCase() results in 'apple'.
Condition Check:
'apple'.startsWith('apple') is true.
'apple' !== 'apple' is false.
Result: This product is excluded because the second condition is false.

Filtered Data
After applying the filter, the resulting array is:



const filteredData = [{ name: 'Applesauce' }];
Mapping to Names

const names = filteredData.map(e => e.name);
Mapping:

.map(e => e.name) iterates over each element e in the filteredData array and extracts the name property to create a new array of names.
Result:


const names = ['Applesauce'];
Summary
Filter Step:

Checks each product name to see if it starts with 'apple' (case-insensitive) and is not exactly 'apple'.
Results in [{ name: 'Applesauce' }].
Map Step:

Extracts the name properties of the filtered products.
Results in ['Applesauce'].
This process ensures that the final names array includes only the product names that start with the searchProduct string but are not exact matches.
